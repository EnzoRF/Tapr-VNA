// DataDisplay.h -- contains the VNA BUFFER typedefs.
// Defines the format of the USB packets to and from the VNA
//
// Update: 06-04-04	TCM		Add new RX buffer type (for fast reads) and REPLYTYPE defines
// Update: 10-22-04 TCM		Add support for extended dynamic range of S21 magnitude.
//							Break QDAC level into Hi and Lo, add S21M HI and S21M Lo types to
//							both FAST and FULL responses.  Reduce FAST response from 5 to 4
//							frequencies per packet.
// Update: 03-18-06 TCM     Change Receive slow buffer to include MID-Level amplitude reading
//							and Transmit slow buffer to add value of Mid level. Change
//							IntegrationCount to MeasurementDelayTime. (Integration is done
//							by host in later versions).  Target code needs to change to
//							accomodate these buffer revisions.
//         10-14-2007 TCM   Define MeasurementSet to encalsulate one set of raw measurements at one
//							point (one discrete frequency).
